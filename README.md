# Unsupervised Learning by Competing Hidden Units, in JAX

**WIP**

## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -U "jax[cuda12]" # Replace with your CUDA version
```

As always, a contained environment through e.g., `conda` or `venv` is recommended.

## Running the code

```
python jax_unsup_learning.py
```

See the evolution of the weights in the `animation.mp4` file.
